## Technologies

**Front**: React, Redux, TypeScript, Chakra UI

**API**: Express, TypeScript, Docker, AWS ECS

## Local Development

From the root directory:

- Run `yarn`
- Start the front end: `yarn start`
- Optionally start the back end: `yarn serve`
  - Note: If you are just working on the front-end, you don't need to run the back-end since the local project is set to use the deployed API. If you want to work with the local API, change [this](https://github.com/trybick/tv-minder/blob/master/front/src/utils/constants.ts) file and request the env files for the api folder in an issue.
